Wish you knew why your pawns were partying the night away? So did I, so I whipped up this mod in a few hours.

Without changing the frequency of parties, colonists will now throw parties over any of over 30 party causes, including:
- a colonist's birthday
- the survival of a major raid
- settling a new tile
- researching beer brewing
- dodging a falling ceiling
- embracing the void

The full list of party causes can be found [here](https://github.com/benjaminiserman/MeaningfulParties/blob/main/Defs/PartyCauses.xml).
